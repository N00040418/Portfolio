        <h2 class="article-heading">\(\mathrm{I}. \text{Introduction} \)</h2>
        <p>Ever since the greeks around 450 BC where Democritus introduced the idea of an atom<a href="#atom" class="citation">\(^{[2]}\) </a> and 600 BC when static electricity was discovered along with the creation of a battery<a href="#mousike" class="citation">\(^{[1]}\) </a> used for lighting, a hole in society's knowledge of electricity was created which was partially filled largely in the 19\(^{\text{th}}\) century.</p>
        <img src="/img/boat.jpg" alt="">
        <p>Consider the atom silicon \(Si\) from silicate compounds, recall that \(Si\) silicon \([Ne]3s^23sp^2\) has \(4\) valence electrons and forms a tetrahedral shape <a href="#silicon" class="citation">\(^{[3]}\) </a>. Thus, we can let \(P=xy\) be an infinitely wide and long rectangular sheet parallel to the azimuthal plane of a crystalline structured quantity of silicone.</p>

        <p>By doping this material with \(P\) phosphorus \([Ne]3s^23p^3\) with \(5\) valence electrons also forms a tetrahedral shape, we allow for the extra electron or negative charge from phosphorus in the silicon lattice to flow freely from its atom all while having a static position for its positive charge. </p>
    
        <p>Photoelectric effect implies that if the imcoming wave has a frequency matching the natural frequency of the particle/molecule then the wave function impacting a single/multiple electrons can cause their wavicle\(^{[4]}\) amplitude to reach its maximum peaks<a href="#photoelectric" class="citation">\(^{[5]}\) </a> allowing for electrons to leave their origin's at tragectories proportional to the incident tragectory of the wave.</p>
